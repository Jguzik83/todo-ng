# Todo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.
This is my first angular todo app. I am not going to lie I followed along with a youtube video.
I will soon be posting my notes as finish editing them.

## GIT NOTES

More importantly this is my first attempt in a long time to refresh myself with the GIT workflow. We don't use VC at my job.
It's more of a don't accidently delete because then its gone forever type of environment.
I will also be publishing notes on my reconfiguration of my brain with GIT.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
